# SnoutScheduler
Final project for SDEV220 Group 4. We are creating an appointment manager program named Snout Scheduler that will be used by a pet grooming business Paws &amp; Relax Grooming. This application will allow customers to schedule grooming appointments for their pets based on groomer availability.
